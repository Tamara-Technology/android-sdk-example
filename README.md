## **Features**
- Example integration of the Tamara Android SDK.
- Demonstrates payment processing and other core features.
- Configurable environment for testing.

---

## **Requirements**
- **Android Studio**: Version 2022.1.1 or higher.
- **Minimum Android SDK Version**: 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop).
- **Target Android SDK Version**: 34.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Download the Example App**
- Download the project as a ZIP file from the provided link or GitHub repository.
- Extract the ZIP file to a local directory.

### **2. Open the Project in Android Studio**
- Launch Android Studio.
- Open the project directory.
- Let Gradle sync automatically.

### **3. Configure Your SDK Credentials**
- Open `AppConst.kt` located in the `src/main/java/com/yourpackage/` directory.
- Update the following fields with your actual credentials:
```kotlin
object AppConst {
    const val AUTH_TOKEN = "your-auth-token" // Replace with your API Token
    const val API_URL = "https://api-sandbox.tamara.co" // Replace with the API URL for sandbox or production
    const val PUBLIC_KEY = "your-public-key" // Replace with your Public Key
    const val NOTIFICATION_WEB_HOOK_URL = "https://your-webhook-url.com" // Replace with your webhook URL
    const val NOTIFICATION_TOKEN = "your-notification-token" // Replace with your notification token
}
```

### **4. Verify Tamara SDK Version**
The `build.gradle` file specifies the Tamara SDK version being used. If needed, update the following line in `build.gradle` to use the desired version:
```gradle
implementation "co.tamara.merchant:android-sdk:1.1.0"
```
> **Note:** Ensure you use the latest compatible version of the Tamara SDK for your app.
